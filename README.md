## Getting Started

#### Client Side Implementation
The client side implementation of imperio represents the use of the mobile functionality to influence browser interaction.
Client-side functionality can be accessed by:

```javascript
<script src='./dist/imperio.min.js'></script>
```
Then you can simply access the imperio object attached to the window.


#### Server Side Implementation

imperio's server functions function as Express middleware. Implementing imperio will require Express to be installed and required.
```bash
npm install --save express
```

imperio's server-side functionality can be enable with just a couple lines of javascript:
Just require the module and pass it the server object of your app
```javascript
const imperio = require('imperio')(server);
```

Add a static route so your client will get the correct files from our node module
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(`${__dirname}/../node_modules/imperio`)));
```

Then have your app use the returned object as middleware
```javascript
app.use(imperio.init());
```
imperio will handle the mobile-to-desktop connections for you!
